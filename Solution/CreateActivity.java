/*
Explanation:
This is a class named CreateActivity that extends another class called ClientActivity. The class has three private instance
variables: a Person object named actor, a StreamObject object named streamObject, and a String named summary. 
The constructor of this class takes four parameters, a String named URI, a String named summary, a Person named actor, 
and a StreamObject named streamObject. The constructor calls the constructor of the parent class ClientActivity and then sets 
the instance variables using the provided parameters.
The class also has setter methods for each of the instance variables, namely setActor, setStreamObject, and setSummary. 
Additionally, it has getter methods for each of the instance variables, namely getActor, getStreamObject, and getSummary.
Without knowing more about the ClientActivity class, it is difficult to determine the exact purpose of this class. 
However, based on the name and the variables, it appears to be modeling an activity that a person is performing on a stream object, 
with a summary describing the activity.
