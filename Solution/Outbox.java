/*
Explanation:
This is an interface named Outbox that extends two other interfaces: SendMessage and DeliverNextMessage. 
It also includes a method signature for getCount() which returns an integer value.
Based on the naming conventions used, it seems that this interface is related to messaging or email systems. 
SendMessage includes methods for composing and sending messages, while DeliverNextMessage includes methods for retrieving and delivering messages from a queue or similar system.
