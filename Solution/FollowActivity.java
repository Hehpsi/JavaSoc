/*
Explanation:
This is a class definition for a FollowActivity, which seems to be part of a larger system or application. 
It extends the generic ClientActivity class, which means it inherits some functionality from that class.
It has four instance variables: actor (of type Person), object (also of type Person), summary (a String), and URI (also a String).
It has a constructor that takes in four parameters (two Strings and two Person objects) and initializes the instance variables using the setters.
It has several setter and getter methods for the instance variables.
It has a follow method that takes in two Person objects and adds the second one to the first one's followers list, and vice versa.
