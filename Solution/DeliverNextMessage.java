public interface DeliverNextMessage 
{
  Activity deliverNext();
}

/*
Explanation:
This is an interface called DeliverNextMessage which declares a single method deliverNext() that returns an object of type Activity. 
The deliverNext() method would retrieve the next message in the queue and return it as an Activity object, 
which could then be processed by the application.
The specific implementation of this interface would depend on the messaging system being used.
