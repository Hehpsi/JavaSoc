/*
Explanation:
This is a class called LikeActivity. 
It extends ClientActivity class and has four private instance variables, summary, actor, streamObject, and a string URI.
It has a constructor that takes four arguments - URI, summary, actor, and streamObject. 
The constructor also calls the constructor of the superclass (ClientActivity) with the URI parameter.
It has several getter and setter methods for the private instance variables.
It also has two methods, like and likesAmount. 
The like method takes two parameters actor and object of type Person and StreamObject, respectively. 
This method adds the object to the liked list of the actor and the actor to the likes list of the object. 
The likesAmount method takes a StreamObject parameter and returns the number of elements in its likes list.
This class seems to represent an activity of liking a StreamObject by a Person. 
The like method allows a Person to like a StreamObject, and the likesAmount method returns the number of likes for a particular StreamObject.
